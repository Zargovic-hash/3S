# Backend Application

This backend application is designed to handle data processing and server-side logic for the project. It is structured to provide a clear separation of concerns, making it easier to maintain and extend.

## Project Structure

- **src/server.js**: Entry point of the application. Initializes the server and sets up middleware and routes.
- **src/controllers/index.js**: Contains the `IndexController` class with methods for handling various routes.
- **src/routes/index.js**: Defines API endpoints and associates them with the corresponding controller methods.
- **src/services/dataProcessor.js**: Contains functions for processing and validating data.
- **src/models/index.js**: Defines data models or schemas used in the application.

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run:

```
npm install
```

## Usage

To start the server, use the following command:

```
npm start
```

The server will run on the specified port, and you can access the API endpoints defined in the routes.
